# Self-driving-cars-safety
A terminal based program which uses machine learning to predict the safety of self driving car.
written in python 2.7.
uses the dataset bikepghpublic.csv for both training and testing.
uses various models of machine learning such as
1]Linear Regression
2]Logistic regression
3]K nearest neighbor classification,
4]support vector machine
5]decision tree classifier.
Gives view of outputs of all these models 
Uses scikit-learn module for machine learning purpose
Also allows use to enter values to check the safety.
